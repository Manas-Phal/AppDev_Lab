## Experiment on JS CRUD Array

# üìò Description
- This project demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations along with various array manipulation techniques using JavaScript (compatible with TypeScript as well). It is a beginner-friendly example for understanding how to handle arrays dynamically through common use cases like adding, reading, updating, deleting, finding, sorting, and clearing data.

# üß™ Operations Performed
**1Ô∏è‚É£ CREATE (Add Elements)**
- Use push() to add a new element to the end of the array.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ READ (Access Elements)**
- Loop through and display all items using forEach().
Access a specific item by index:

**3Ô∏è‚É£ UPDATE (Modify Elements)**
- Update a specific item by directly accessing the index:
Use map() to update all items (e.g., appending a label):

**4Ô∏è‚É£ DELETE (Remove Elements)**
- Remove a specific item by index using splice():
- Remove items conditionally using filter():

**5Ô∏è‚É£ FIND (Search in Array)**
- Use find() to get the first item matching a condition:

**6Ô∏è‚É£ SORT (Alphabetical Order)**
- Sort items using sort():

**7Ô∏è‚É£ REVERSE (Change Order)**
- Reverse the array using reverse():

**8Ô∏è‚É£ CLEAR (Empty the Array)**
- Clear all elements by setting length to zero:
- list.length = 0;
